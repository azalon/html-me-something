        <h1> The Zero Waste Heirarchy</h1>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Refuse</li>
            <p>Just say no! This can seem hard at first (trust me, 
                I like free things as much as the next guy), but it gets easier over time. 
                Say no to freebies you don't need and won't use. Say no to straws if you 
                don't require them. </p>
            <li>Reduce</li>
            <p>Look at your waste. What do you get rid of the most? 
                Maybe it's the extra avocado you bought that went bad or the ziploc baggies 
                from five days of work lunches. Either way, what can you do to reduce your waste? 
                Maybe think twice about buying that avocado next week. Maybe take a resuable 
                baggy or container for your lunch instead </p>
            <li>Reuse/Repair</li>
            <p> If it's broke, fix it! If you can't or don't want to pay for someone else to do it, 
                consider giving it away to someone who can. List your item for free on craigslist or 
                on a buy nothing page. You never know who will find treasure in your trash. Reuse your stuff! 
                Wear your clothes until they no longer function instead of buying a new outfit for every occassion.

            </p>
            <li>Recycle</li>
            <p>When absolutely necessary, recycle. Choose glass and alumimum over plastic. 
                Offer up your empty kombucha bottles on freecycle. 
            </p>
            <li>Rot(compost)</li>
            <p>When things come up and you can't make it to those leftovers from Thursday night, compost 
                your food waste. When food waste is discarded via land fills and placed in suffocating plastic
                garbage bags, methane is released. Instead, your food waste can be brought back to the soil
                through composting and used to grow new produce. What's more beautiful than that?
            </p>
            <li>Borrow and share</li>
            <p>Take books out from the library instead of buying them. Need that sewing machine one time? 
                Find someone who already has one or join a makerspace where you can borrow lots of different tools. 
                Does your friend have a wedding to go to and needs a suit? Let him borrow yours! 
                The more sharing, the less waste. </p>
            <li>Buy used</li>
            <p>Don't have a friend with a suit your size? Look at thrift stores, eBay, and Poshmark before buying new. 
                There is most likely someone somewhere trying to sell whatever you're in the market for. Keep used items out 
                of landfills by giving them new life. The best part is, when you're done with your suit, resell it! 
                An infinite loop...
            </p>

        <h2>Kitchen</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your diet</li>
                <p>Eat plant-based! Save water, save the animals, and feel better!

                </p>
                <img src="images/vegan_food.jpg" class="image"/>
                <li>Your tools</li>
                <p>Get your kitchen tools secondhand. Find an estate sale or go to a thrift shop. 
                    Maybe you only need that kitchen mixer once a year- borrow from a friend!
                    Swap paper towels and napkins for cloth towels and napkins. 
                </p>
                <li>Your water</li>
                <p> Run the dishwasher without pre-washing by hand (washing dishes is its job not yours!). 
                    Eating plant-based is the biggest water saving decision you can make. 
                </p>
                <li>Cleaning Products</li>
                <p>The great news is that you can make your own. Dilute white vinegar with water for
                    an all purpose cleaning spray. You can even add citrus peels or essential oils to give 
                    it the scent you desire. Swap out swiffer pads for a cloth pads you can wash or a mop with
                    a washable mop head. Did you know you can compost your dust, lint, and even hair?
                </p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Bathroom</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your tools</li>
                <p> Swap your plastic toothbrush for a bamboo toothbrush you can compost. 
                    Use shampoo and soap bars instead of buying bottles. Or buy in bulk by bringing 
                    your own containers. Swap out tissues for reusable hankies. Make your own makeup 
                    pads from an old tshirt. Buy recycled toilet paper or
                    better yet- a bidet attachment! Look at your toiletries and decide if you 
                    really need them all. What can you do without? What can you make on your own?
                    What can you buy in bulk?
                </p>
            
            </ul>
            
    
        </p>
        <h2> Outside the home</h2>
        <p>Your choices outside the home make a difference too.
            Bring your own containers, napkins, and utensils 
            when eating out and for taking home leftovers. Pack your
            lunch in resuable and washable containers to avoid throwing out ziploc
            bags. Bring your own water bottle. Air dry your hands or use
            a hand dryer instead of taking paper towels. Carpool when you can. 
            Bring your own reusable bags when out shopping. Better yet, always keep one 
            on you just in case you need to pick something up. Resuable bags are more durable
            and they keep plastic bags out of landfills. Try to use what you already own 
            or if you don't own any, pick some up at secondhand stores for cheap!
